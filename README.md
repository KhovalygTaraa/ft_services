# ft_services

### Run
In first you should install minikube - "brew install minikube"
In second we need Docker. Download docker from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
Than you should run setup.sh script - "bash setup.sh"
At least, write next command - minikube dashboard. There you will find "Pods" part and ip adresses of services on localhost.
